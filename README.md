## プロジェクト関連のメモ。

- epoc ごとに評価して、その値が悪くなったときのみ lr を下げるというテクニックがよく使われる。
- PyTorch のチュートリアルに、ResNet からのファインチューニングを birds のデータに適用するコードあり
- Google Drive 上に学習データを持っておくとよいかも



Submit the url to your project website. The website should have your project video as well as the content described in the Ed post (as applicable):

Problem description
Previous work (including what you used for your method i.e. pretrained models)
Your approach
Datasets
Results
Discussion
What problems did you encounter?
Are there next steps you would take if you kept working on the project?
How does your approach differ from others? Was that beneficial?



以下Edのコピペ
Explore any aspect of CV that interests you

Should probably include substantial coding of your own but I encourage you to also use outside libraries/frameworks (pytorch, tensorflow, opencv, etc.)

Should be roughly equivalent in work to 2 homework in technical work/scope

Deliverable: Your final project presentation will be a website describing your project, and a 2-3 minute video. This summary should mention the problem setup, data used, techniques, etc. It should include a description of which components were from preexisting work (i.e. code from github) and which components were implemented for the project (i.e. new code, gathered dataset, etc).
